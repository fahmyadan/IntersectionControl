# Welcome to IntersectionControl's documentation!

This project provides an environment-agnostic framework for implementing and comparing intersection control 
algorithms - both centralised and decentralised.

The source code can be found on [github](https://github.com/julesdehon/IntersectionControl), and forms a part of the 
output of my BEng Computing Thesis at Imperial College London. 

## What will you find here?

The purpose of this documentation is to provide:
1. An [installation guide](usage/installation.md) for setting up the framework in your own project
2. A [quickstart guide](usage/quickstart.md) showing how you might use the framework, using an already-implemented 
   intersection control algorithm and environment
3. An [overview](overview/overview.md) of the structure of the project, and how the different components interact.
4. Provide the [API](api/index.md) of the different components of the project - this part of the documentation is 
   almost entirely generated automatically from comments in the project's source code, so it may be just as useful 
   to look through the source code directly.
