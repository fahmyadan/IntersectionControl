# Welcome to IntersectionControl's documentation!

This project provides an environment-agnostic framework for implementing and comparing intersection control 
algorithms - both centralised and decentralised.

## What will you find here?

The purpose of this documentation is to provide:
1. An [installation guide](usage/installation.md) for setting up the framework in your own project
2. A [quickstart guide](usage/quickstart.md) showing how you might use the framework, using an already-implemented 
   intersection control algorithm and environment
3. An [overview](overview/overview.md) of the structure of the project, and how the different components interact.
4. Provide the [API](api/index.md) of the different components of the project
